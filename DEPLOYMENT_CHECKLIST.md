   ```

2. **Verify Environment Variables**:

   # In your .env.production file
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://family.themewfi.xyz
   ```

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Authentication Testing
- [ ] Sign up with new email - verify email goes to correct domain
- [ ] Email confirmation works and redirects to production URL
- [ ] Password reset works with correct URLs
- [ ] Login works correctly
- [ ] Logout works correctly

### Family Functionality

- [ ] Invite links generate with correct domain
- [ ] Family management works

### PWA Testing
- [ ] Service worker registers correctly
- [ ] App can be installed on mobile devices

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Email URLs pointing to localhost
**Problem**: Signup confirmation emails contain localhost URLs instead of production domain.

**Solutions**:
1. **Check Supabase Site URL**: Must be set to `https://family.themewfi.xyz`
2. **Verify Environment Variable**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://family.themewfi.xyz`
3. **Clear Browser Cache**: Old settings might be cached
4. **Test with New Email**: Use a fresh email address that hasn't been used before

### Authentication Redirects Not Working
**Problem**: After email confirmation, redirects don't work properly.

**Solutions**:
1. **Check Redirect URLs**: Add all necessary URLs to Supabase auth settings
2. **Verify Callback Handler**: Ensure `/auth/callback` page exists and works
3. **Check URL Patterns**: Ensure wildcard patterns like `/invite/*` are properly configured

### Environment Variables Not Loading
**Problem**: Production environment variables aren't being loaded.

**Solutions**:
1. **File Location**: Ensure `.env.production` is in the root directory
2. **Docker Configuration**: Check if environment variables are passed to container
3. **Next.js Prefix**: Ensure client-side variables have `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix

## üìã Post-Deployment Verification

- [ ] Application loads correctly at `https://family.themewfi.xyz`
- [ ] All static assets load over HTTPS
- [ ] Authentication flow works end-to-end
- [ ] Email confirmations work with correct URLs
- [ ] Database operations work correctly
- [ ] Real-time subscriptions work
- [ ] PWA features work (installation, offline mode)

## üîê Security Checklist

- [ ] All environment variables are properly secured
- [ ] Supabase RLS policies are enabled and tested
- [ ] HTTPS is enforced
- [ ] No sensitive data in client-side code
- [ ] API keys are properly scoped

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check Supabase logs for authentication issues
3. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
4. Test with a clean browser session/incognito mode
5. Check Docker logs if using containerized deployment

**Note**: The main cause of localhost URLs in emails is usually the Supabase Site URL configuration. Always verify this setting first when encountering email redirect issues.
